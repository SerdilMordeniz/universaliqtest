		"paragraph": "<p>Universaliqtest is a private comppany. We created a universal iq test that is assessing ones mental ability. The test consists of questions where no language or any other cultural background would be necessary. Our test has 49 questions. This usually takes our customers about 45 mins to answer. At the end of the test we give your intelligence quotient (IQ) in your age category. Furthermore we also compare your mental ability within your continent (continent IQ), how well you did compared to everyone (worldwide IQ), how well you did in your study level (Study Level IQ) and within your study area (study area IQ). We don't store any private information about a client. The clients privacy is very important to us.</p>"

Note that the average standard IQ is set at 100 for historical reasons. The test you passed was designed to have an average score of 100. This allows each candidate to compare their result with statistics and various parameters.<br/><br/>Based on the results of the completed test, <4>your IQ score is {{textIq}}.</4>This IQ value is an estimate. Your result may change depending on your current form and the conditions under which you take the test. Below you can see more details about your result.
